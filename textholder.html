<p>As the 1970s unfolded, Stevie Wonder was on a direct trajectory towards perfection. After going number one with “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours,” a song he personally co-wrote and produced (a rarity for a Motown artist like himself), Wonder hit the ground running. </p>
<p>It began with Where I’m Coming From, an album that critics tend to exclude from the upper tiers of Wonder’s discography. In promotional interviews for the album, Wonder went to great lengths to explain that this was the first album which he had personally masterminded. As great as the album was, though, it was only a sign of things to come. 
</p>
<p>A month after Where I’m Coming From’s release, Wonder turned 21 years old and demanded an unprecedented level of creative control from his label. What ensued was the classic period – a period of five years in which Wonder released five of the greatest albums of all time. By 1973, he was already three albums deep into his classic period, and his most recent album, Innervisions, was his most celebrated yet. 
</p>
<p>A 23 year old Wonder would not get to bask in the greatness of his latest release for long, though, as tragedy would strike only three days after its release. On August 6, 1973, Wonder sat in the passenger’s seat of a rented Mercury Cruiser as his driver, distracted, drove the car into the back of a Dodge flatbed truck. The young star was struck in the head during the resulting crash, leaving him with a bruised brain and severe bleeding. 
</p>
<p>Rushed to the hospital, Wonder’s life held on by a thread. It would take a life-saving surgery by the president of the Neurological Society of America to keep the artist alive. In the following days, Wonder was comatose, taking weeks to fully recover. As he began his return to the public eye, he maintained a redefined vision on life. This vision manifested in his next album. 
</p>
<p>To understand why 1974’s Fulfillingness’ First Finale, Wonder’s subsequent album, is so unique, it is important to grasp the trajectory that he was on beforehand. Innervisions, an album that remains today as one of his most acclaimed ever, demanded its respect with a fiery passion. With each album he released, Wonder departed more and more from just writing love songs; out of the concise set of nine songs on the Innervisions, only three dealt with love directly. The rest of the tracklist faced real life issues head-on, drafting grand statements about what was and wasn’t right with the world. In line with the album’s title, Wonder searched inwards for solutions to the many outward problems he faced. 
</p>
<p>FFF does concern itself with the outside world. In the wake of the car crash, Wonder had had enough of everyone else, choosing to prioritize his own problems over the politics or troubles of the time. Nowhere is this clearer than in track eight: “They Won’t Go When I Go.” Over Chopin-inspired, classical instrumentation, Wonder sings of what might be the rapture. He looked around and saw evil and sin at every turn, and instead of concerning himself with bettering the world, he took a step back and accepted the helplessness of it all. He was a good man, and at that point, that was all that mattered. He knew that he would be saved, and as for everyone else? As the title suggested, they might get saved too, but they wouldn’t go when he went. 
</p>
<p>Possibly the song with the greatest legacy on the album, “They Won’t Go When I Go” continues to reverberate in the collective consciousness to this day. George Michael, facing the ongoing AIDs crisis of the 80s, covered Wonder’s song for 1990’s Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1. In 2011, Kanye quietly covered the song at a party in the MoMa. Today, the track’s somber chords and haunting lyrics remain a staple at mourning services the world over. 
</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the album, Wonder reasserts his faith. On “Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away,” the album's second track, he sings of his friends lacking faith and doubting God, Wonder proclaims that he can feel God’s spirit “in [his] heart.” As the world around him seemingly spiraled towards decay, Wonder held onto God to keep him safe. 
</p>
<p>In spite of the darkness he suggests, though, FFF is not all dreary. In Wonder’s departure from the wider problems of the world, he takes time across the tracklist to focus on the idiosyncrasies of human emotion. In his songwriting, then, Wonder takes a simplistic, almost minimalist approach to thematic choice. See Wonder’s approach to positivity, highlighted by “Smile Please” and “Bird of Beauty,” tracks 1 and 9 respectively. These songs focus on such little details of life, attempting to uplift the spirit with the most basic tools available. The former, as the title suggests, reminds the listener to smile. “A smiling face is an Earth-like star,” he sings, imploring us to relish in the privilege of being happy. “Bird of Beauty,” meanwhile, tells us to calm our minds. Across infectious Latin-inspired instrumentation, Wonder sings in both English and Portuguese, asserting that happiness comes not from some packaged pill but rather from within. 
</p>
<p>The rest of the tracklist is dedicated to love – love manifested in its highest highs, lowest lows, and every confusing place in between. “Creepin,” track 5 on the album, serves as a testament to Wonder’s approach on this album. In a song of yearning and desire, Wonder asks his love interest whether he creeps into her dreams the way she creeps into his. In a song proclaiming the “amazing” feeling of love, Wonder simultaneously laments the loneliness of dedicating one’s dreams to a love not-quite-requited. Elsewhere, Wonder juxtaposes sonic similarities with directly opposing themes. Track 3, “Too Shy to Say” is another ballad of yearning. Wonder finds himself so deeply in love with someone else, but alas, he has not the courage to speak his truth. On track 7 (“It Ain’t No Use”), meanwhile, Wonder sings a ballad of a love that is most certainly over. This time, though, he has no trouble saying it. Across two ballads that are not totally unalike, Wonder imagines two completely different states of love. The complexity of love only furthers, though, with the last track of the album. “Please Don’t Go,” track ten, is one of the most upbeat songs on the entire album. In spite of its sound, though, the song is another of yearning; in it, Wonder holds onto a love that is already halfway out the door. The paradoxical nature relationship between the song’s aesthetics and lyrics reflect the twisted beauty of love. In all of its joy and pain, highs and lows, the holistic experience of love is what makes it so great. Maybe we can take that understanding of love and apply it to life as a whole. 
</p>
<p>There is one caveat to the tracklist depicted, though, and that is in track 6. The one and only overtly political song on the album, “You Haven’t Done Nothing,” was also the only single from the album to go number one. The track, featuring the Jackson 5 on background vocals, laments the Nixon presidency in fiery fashion. Two days after the release of the single, Nixon would – coincidentally – resign. Even in an album as personal and introspective as FFF, Wonder reminds us that some problems are just too big and exigent to be ignored. 
</p>
<p>In a review for AllMusic, John Bush wrote that FFF “ is more a collection of excellent songs than an excellent album.” If one takes this to be true, then it still stands that Fulfillingness' First Finale might just be the greatest mere collection of “excellent songs” ever. It might not have the cohesive vision of Wonder’s other great albums, but what it lacks in conceptuality it makes up for in raw poetry, songwriting, and emotion. Wonder might have taken a detour from crafting perfect and cohesive and crowd-pleasing albums, but he ended up taking one of the most scenic and pleasing detours we’ve ever seen. 
</p>
<p>He did not stray from his trajectory for long, though, as Wonder returned only 2 years later with Songs in the Key of Life. Not only is this album his most acclaimed ever, but it is often lauded as one of the greatest albums ever made. Such an album only reinforces the status of FFF as the oddball of Wonder’s classic run. After the car crash, Wonder temporarily stepped down as the preeminent voice at the intersection of music and politics, focussing on himself and his innermost emotions. His return to critical acclaim solidified his status as one of the greatest artists ever, proving that he could not only make great music, but he could make it in any way that he wanted to. For what it's worth, even as the most forgotten album from Wonder’s perfect run, Fulfillingness’ First Finale still managed to win the Grammy for Album of the Year. Some levels of genius are just too great to be ignored, it seems.
